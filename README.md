  For this project, I am proposing to code an expense tracker for personal or business use. This code will require the user to first 
identify the 3 product expenses they need to keep track of, as well as their payroll. This code will be for a 4-employee payroll,
all of whom are on hourly pay, which will be imputed by the user. The expenses of the product will be measured in dollars per pound. 
This program will calculate the cost of labor before taxes each week based on how many hours each person worked. It will also display
the cost of any used product based on the weight, plus the labor cost for a total amount spent per week. 
  This code will make it easier for the business to calculate how much they are spending per week and will make it so they can use this
data to determine how much profit they are making, or set prices to accurately make a profit. It will simplify the data for the users 
and keep it in a compact place, so they only need to enter the inputs, and it will give them a total cost and a labor cost. That way, 
they can see if the labor they are spending is over or under their profit margins, and they can determine if they need to cut back on 
labor or if they can afford to add to it.
